TODO: binary

 * Multiple id's - essentially an id alias, or think of as name and id, etc.
 * Solo-attributes always before attribute-value-pairs
 * Explicit line continuations when line ends in a backslash
 * Optional pipe on: [.
 * Needs escape to start and be in a line of text: ' " . [ | # : !

== Templating

|process [1]
    .private
    |color : red
  :with[$.tasks|t] when: t.awesome > 7
    |task [$t.name}] $t.best_attrib: $t[3]
  |'This should be ok'|
  
|process [2]
  |color: $process[1].color
  :if[color > 0x232323]
    |background-color: blue
  :else
    |background-color: white
  |'Actually no tasks here. muahaha'|

 * $. (blank name) is the namespace for data passed into the template
 * $something.child is equivalent to ${something.child}
 * For now control constructs & directives are simply implemented as specials
 * Exposed interpolation (no curly braces) has a limited syntax (more so than rest of code?)
