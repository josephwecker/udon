      |para
        DocBook is a general purpose |{xref :linkend xml-rec} schema particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications). 
      |para The Version 5.0 release is a complete rewrite of DocBook in RELAX NG. The intent of this rewrite is to produce a schema that is true to the spirit of DocBook while simultaneously removing inconsistencies that have arisen as a natural consequence of DocBook's long, slow evolution. The Technical Committee has taken this opportunity to simplify a number of content models and tighten constraints where RELAX NG makes that possible. 
      |para The Technical Committee provides the DocBook 5.0 schema in other schema languages, including W3C XML Schema and an XML DTD, but the RELAX NG Schema is now the normative schema.

  |section[s.intro]
    |title Introduction
    |para DocBook is general purpose XML schema particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications). 
    |para
      The |{link :href mailto:docbook-tc@oasis-open.org DocBook Technical Committee} maintains the DocBook schema. Starting with V5.0, DocBook is normatively available as a |{xref :linkend relaxng} Schema (with some additional Schematron assertions). W3C XML Schema and Document Type Definition (DTD) versions are also available. 
    |para The Version 5.0 release is a complete rewrite. In programming-language terms, think of it as a code refactoring.
    |para This rewrite introduces a large number of backwards-incompatible changes. Essentially all DocBook V4.x documents will have to be modified to validate against DocBook V5.0. An XSLT 1.0 stylesheet is provided to ease this transition.
    |para
      The DocBook Technical Committee welcomes bug reports and requests for enhancement (RFEs) from the user community. The current list of outstanding requests is available through the |{link :href http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge}|{link :href http://sourceforce.net/tracker/?atid=384107&group_id=21935&func=browse tracker}|{link :href http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/old-rfes.html archived}
    |section[s.terminology]
      |title Terminology
      |para
        The key words |{glossterm must}, |{glossterm must not}, |{glossterm required}, |{glossterm shall}, |{glossterm shall not}, |{glossterm should}, |{glossterm should not}, |{glossterm recommended}, |{glossterm may}, and |{glossterm optional} in this Committee Draft are to be interpreted as described in |{xref :linkend rfc2119}. Note that for reasons of style, these words are not capitalized in this document.

    |title The DocBook RELAX NG Schema
    |para
      The DocBook |{link :href http://docs.oasis-open.org/docbook/rng/ RELAX NG Schema} is distributed from the |{link :href http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/ DocBook site} at |{link :href http://www.oasis-open.org/ OASIS}. DocBook is also available from the mirror on |{link :href http://docbook.org/}. 
    |para In V5.0, DocBook has been rewritten as a native RELAX NG grammar. The goals of this redesign were to produce a schema that:
    |orderedlist
      |listitem
        |para “feels like” DocBook. Most existing documents should still be valid or it should be possible to transform them in simple, mechanical ways into valid documents. 
      |listitem
        |para enforces as many constraints as possible in the schema. Some additional constraints are expressed with Schematron rules. 
      |listitem
        |para cleans up the content models. 
      |listitem
        |para gives users the flexibility to extend or subset the schema in an easy and straightforward way. 
      |listitem
        |para can be used to generate XML DTD and W3C XML Schema versions of DocBook. 
    |para
      Under the ordinary operating rules of DocBook evolution, the only backwards incompatible changes that could be made in DocBook V5.0 were those announced in DocBook V4.0. In light of the fact that this is a complete rewrite, the Technical Committee gave itself the freedom to make |{quote unannounced} backwards-incompatible changes for this one release.
    |section[s.remvlegacy]
      |title Removing Legacy Elements
      |para A number of elements have been removed from DocBook. Many of these have been replaced by simpler, more versatile alternatives. Others have simply been removed because they are not believed to be widely used:

            |para Removed. 
    |section[s.smaller.cm]
      |title Smaller Content Models
      |para The content models of many inlines have been reduced, sometimes drastically. The parameter entity customization of DocBook V4.x and previous versions resulted in very broad content models for some inlines.
      |para
        Consider, for example, |{tag command} in DocBook V4.4:
      |programlisting command ::= (#PCDATA|link|olink|ulink|action|application|classname|methodname| interfacename|exceptionname|ooclass|oointerface|ooexception| command|computeroutput|database|email|envar|errorcode|errorname| errortype|errortext|filename|function|guibutton|guiicon|guilabel| guimenu|guimenuitem|guisubmenu|hardware|interface|keycap|keycode| keycombo|keysym|literal|code|constant|markup|medialabel| menuchoice|mousebutton|option|optional|parameter|prompt|property| replaceable|returnvalue|sgmltag|structfield|structname|symbol| systemitem|uri|token|type|userinput|varname|nonterminal|anchor| remark|subscript|superscript|inlinegraphic|inlinemediaobject| indexterm|beginpage)*
      |para
        In DocBook V5.0, |{tag command} has a much smaller, more rational content model:
      |programlisting
        |emphasis text
      |para DocBook V5.0 may be overzealous in its simplification of content models. The Technical Committee expects to adjust these simplifications during user testing. Users are encouraged to report places where formally valid documents can no longer be made valid because content models have been reduced.
    |section[s.unif.info]
      |title Uniform Info Elements
      |para
        DocBook V4.x has |{tag setinfo}, |{tag bookinfo}, |{tag chapterinfo}, |{tag appendixinfo}, |{tag sectioninfo}, etc. DocBook would be smaller and simpler if it had a single |{tag info} element in all these places.
      |para
        There
        ’s an historical reason for the large number of unique names: customizers might very well want to adjust the content models of info elements at different levels. For example, a copyright statement might be required at the book level, or an author forbidden at the sub-section level. In DTDs, there’
        s only one content model allowed per element name, so in order to support independent customization, each info element must have a different name.
      |para
        In RELAX NG, no such limitation exists. We can use patterns to achieve both a single |{tag info} element while still allowing customizers to change its content model in different contexts. In light of this functionality, we've replaced all the various flavors of info with a single element name.
    |section[s.req.titles]
      |title Required Titles
      |para
        DocBook V5.0 enforces the constraint that titles are required on |{tag article}s and other large structures where they are effectively optional in DocBook V4.x. (They are optional only in the sense that DTDs are unable to enforce the constraint that they be present, the documentation has always made it clear that titles were required.)
    |section[s.req.version]
      |title Required Version
      |para In DocBook V4.x and earlier, the presence of a document type declaration served as a mechanism for identifying the DocBook version of a document. Although the declaration was not actually required, it was present in the vast majority of DocBook documents.
      |para In RELAX NG, no similar declaration exists. Although a document type declaration might still be present, it seems likely that this will not usually be the case.
      |para
        Nevertheless, downstream processors may benefit from some indication of the version of DocBook being used. As a result DocBook V5.0 adds a new |{tag.attribute version} attribute which |{glossterm must} be present on the document element of a DocBook document.
      |para Mixing versions is explicitly allowed and the version attribute may be used on other elements as well. This might be the case, for example, in a compound document constructed from multiple documents each with its own version.
    |section[s.co-constraints]
      |title Co-Constraints
      |para
        DocBook V5.0 enforces attribute co-constraints such as the |{tag.attribute class}/|{tag.attribute otherclass}|{tag biblioid}.
    |section[s.tables]
      |title Improved HTML and CALS Table Support
      |para In DocBook V5.0, HTML tables and CALS tables are independently specified. Where the DTD of DocBook V4.x allows for incoherent mixing of the two models, DocBook V5.0 forbids such mixtures.
    |section[s.datatypes]
      |title Data Types
      |para
        DocBook V5.0 adds a few simple data types. For example, the |{tag.attribute cols} attribute on |{tag tgroup}
      |para
        Some of these constraints, such as the requirement that elements like |{tag pubdate} include a proper date-time type, may prove controversial. Users are encouraged to report places where formally valid documents can no longer be made valid because data types have been introduced. 
    |section[s.ubiq.link]
      |title Universal Linking
      |para
        Starting with DocBook V5.0, the |{tag.attribute linkend} and |{tag.attribute xlink:href} attributes are available on almost all elements.
      |para
        The |{tag.attribute linkend} attribute provides an ID/IDREF link within the document. The |{tag.attribute xlink:href} attribute provides a URI-based link.
      |para
        The |{tag ulink} element has been removed from DocBook as URI-based links can now be achieved directly from the appropriate inline (such as |{tag productname} or |{tag command}). For instances where no specific semantic inline is needed, |{tag link} is still available. Where |{tag link} used to be limited to ID/IDREF linking, it now sports an |{tag.attribute xlink:href} attribute as well.
      |para
        Support for |{link :href http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/#extended-link | extended links}|{tag extendedlink}, |{tag arc}, and |{tag locator} elements.
    |section[s.annot]
      |title Improved Accessibility
      |para
        Accessibility is improved by allowing both inline and block annotations in most context. The |{tag alt} element is now allowed in most places for inline annotations, the new element |{tag annotation} supports block annotations.
    |section[s.toc]
      |title Simplified Table of Contents Markup
      |para
        The DocBook V4.x markup for Tables of Contents, or more generally for Lists of Titles, was complex and had not evolved quite in step with the rest of DocBook. In DocBook V5.0, it has all been replaced by a quite simple, recursive |{tag toc}/|{tag tocdiv}/|{tag tocentry}
      |para
        While most Tables of Contents and Lists of Titles are generated automatically and authors never have to produce markup for them by hand, this simplified content model should make it easier for authors to generate them when necessary. One possible application of hand-authored |{tag toc} markup is to generate custom hierarchies which can be assembled on-the-fly from a library of topics marked up in DocBook.
    |section[s.schematron]
      |title Extra-Grammatical Constraints
      |para
        Grammar based validation technologies (like RELAX NG) and rule based validation technologies (like Schematron) are naturally complementary. Mixing them allows us to play to the strengths of each without stretching either to enforce constraints that they aren
        ’t readily designed to enforce.
      |para
        For example, DocBook NG requires that the root element of a document have an explicit version attribute. Because there are a great many elements that can be root elements in DocBook, and because they can almost all appear as descendants of a root element as well, it would be tedious to express this constraint in RELAX NG. But it is
        easy in a rule-based schema language.
      |para DocBook V5.0 uses Schematron where appropriate.
    |section[s.custom]
      |title Customization
      |para From the very beginning, one of the goals of DocBook has been that users should be able to produce customizations that are either subsets of extensions of DocBook.
      |para Customization is possible in DocBook V4.x, but because of the intricacies of XML DTD syntax and the complex and highly stylized patterns of parameter entitiy usage in DocBook, it's not as easy as we would like it to be.
      |para In DocBook V5.0, we hope to take advantage of RELAX NGs more robust design (and it's lack of pernicious determinism rules) to make customization easier.
      |para Three schema design patterns get us most of the way there.
      |section[s.patnames]
        |title Logical Groupings
        |para DocBook elements, particularly the inlines, can be divided into broad classes: general purpose, technical, error-related, operating-system related, bibliographic, publishing, etc. In DocBook V5.0, these are collected together in named patterns.
        |para
          To add a new inline, |{literal endpoint} for example, to the list of technical inlines, one need only extend the appropriate pattern. If an element should appear in several classes, they can all be extended in the same way:
        |programlisting db.technical.inlines |= endpoint db.programming.inlines |= endpoint db.os.inlines |= endpoint
        |para Much the same concept was used in DocBook V4.x, where instead of patterns we had parameter entities. However, the constraints of DTD validation severely limit the circumstances under which an element can appear twice in a content model. That meant that adding an element to one parameter entity might make it an error to add it to another. Such constraints do not exist in RELAX NG which greatly simplifies the customization.
      |section[s.elemdefs]
        |title Element Definitions
        |para
          Each element in DocBook V5.0 is defined by its own pattern. To change the content model of an element, only that pattern need be redefined. To remove an element from DocBook, that pattern can be redefined as |{quote |{literal notAllowed}}.
      |section[s.attrdefs]
        |title Attribute Definitions
        |para
          Each attribute list in DocBook V5.0 is defined by its own pattern. To change the list of attributes available on an element, only that pattern need be redefined. To remove all the attributes, that pattern can be redefined as |{quote |{literal empty}}.
    |section[s.conversion]
      |title Conversion
      |para
        There
        ’s an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet for performing conversion from DocBook V4.x to DocBook V5.0. Presented with a valid DocBook V4.x document, it attempts to produce a valid DocBook V5.0 document.
      |para It succeeds entirely automatically for the most part, though human intervention is suggested for constructs that might have multiple interpretations (and therefore multiple possible transformations).
      |para Users are encouraged to report documents that are not successfully transformed by the stylesheet, especially those which do have valid DocBook V5.0 representations. 
  |section[s.relnotes]
    |title Release Notes
    |para
      See |{link :href http://www.relaxng.org/} for a list of tools that can validate an XML document using RELAX NG. Note that not all products are capable of evaluating the Schematron assertions in the schema.
  |appendix[a.mimetype]

    |para
      This appendix registers a new MIME media type, |{quote |{code application/docbook+xml}}.

            Added |{literal db.publishing.inlines} to |{literal db.bibliographic.elements} so that, for example, |{tag foreignphrase} can be used in |{tag bibliomixed}. 
    |section[s.50b5]
      |title Changes in DocBook V5.0b5
      |para This release contains several improvements over V5.0b4.
      |orderedlist
        |listitem[refmiscinfo2]
          |para
            Restored the |{tag.attribute class} attribute on |{tag refmiscinfo} (removing the |{tag.attribute type}|{link :linkend refmiscinfo introduced} in |{link :linkend s.50b4 V5.0b4}). The |{tag.attribute class}|{tag.attribute otherclass} extension point.
        |listitem[parameter]
          |para
            Added |{tag parameter} to |{literal db.technical.inlines}. This allows |{tag parameter} to occur in places like |{tag userinput} and |{tag computeroutput}. 
        |listitem[xinclude]
          |para
            Allow XInclude elements in |{tag info} elements (in the |{filename docbookxi} schemas). 
        |listitem[dtdgen]
          |para Fixed bugs in the build process that resulted in broken DTD versions of beta 4 and earlier betas.
    |section[s.50b4]
      |title Changes in DocBook V5.0b4
      |para This release contains several improvements over V5.0b3.
      |orderedlist
        |listitem[rfe.1416903]
          |para
            Fixed |{link :href http://sourceforce.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&group_id=21935&atid=384107&aid=1416903 RFE 1416903}: Added a |{tag cover} element to hold additional material for document covers. Updated reference documentation. 
        |listitem[pubsnumber]
          |para
            Corrected a typo in the list of values allowed on the |{tag.attribute class} attribute of |{tag biblioid}: changed “pubnumber” to “pubsnumber” (note the “s”). This is consistent with its use as a replacement for the |{tag pubsnumber} tag that has been removed in DocBook V5.0.
        |listitem[titles]
          |para
            Fixed a bug in the content model of the various “|{tag info}” elements. In previous beta releases, the title-related elements (|{tag title}, |{tag titleabbrev}, and |{tag subtitle}) were erroneously required to appear first. The requirement is only that they appear exactly or at most once, depending on the context.
        |listitem[sgmlcomment]
          |para
            Renamed the “|{tag.attvalue sgmlcomment}” attribute value of the |{tag.attribute class} attribute of |{tag tag}. There's no significant difference between XML and SGML comments and the “SGML” name implies that there ought to be an “|{tag.attvalue xmlcomment}” value, which there is not. The new value is simply “|{tag.attvalue comment}”. 
        |listitem[refmiscinfo]
          |para
            Renamed the “|{tag.attribute class}” attribute of |{tag refmiscinfo}. The DocBook semantics of class attributes is that they have enumerated values. This attribute should always have been called “|{tag.attribute type}” as it is now. 
        |listitem[otherclass]
          |para
            Updated |{tag.attribute renderas} on |{tag bridgehead} and |{tag.attribute class} on |{tag othercredit} to have “attribute/otherattribute” co-constraints. (In other words, if you select “other” for |{tag.attribute renderas} on |{tag bridgehead}|{tag.attribute class} on |{tag othercredit}, you have to also provide a value for |{tag.attribute otherrenderas}|{tag.attribute othercredit}, respectively.
        |listitem[width]
          |para
            Changed |{tag.attribute width} attribute in media objects to be “text” instead of “|{code xs:integer}”. 
        |listitem[xmlschema]
          |para
            Fixed bug in the build process that resulted in unusable XML Schema versions of beta
             
            2 and beta
             
            3.
        |listitem[docs.b4]
          |para Improved reference documentation for attributes on many elements. 
    |section[s.50b3]
      |title Changes in DocBook V5.0b3
      |para This release contains several small improvements over V5.0b2.
      |orderedlist
        |listitem[rfe.1358844]
          |para
            Fixed |{link :href http://sourceforce.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&group_id=21935&atid=384107&aid=1358844 RFE 1358844}: allow multiple |{tag imageobject}s inside an |{tag imageobjectco}. Updated reference documentation. 
        |listitem[attribute.defaults]
          |para
            Restored default values to the |{tag.attribute type} attribute on |{tag simplelist}|{tag.attribute choice} and |{tag.attribute rep} attributes on |{tag methodparam}, |{tag arg}, and |{tag group}. Fixed a bug in |{tag paramdef} where |{tag.attvalue plain} was accidentally allowed as a |{tag.attribute choice}. These defaults are reflected in the generated XML DTD as well.
        |listitem[blockquote] |para Reduced the content model of |{tag blockquote} which seemed way too broad.
        |listitem[docs.b3] |para Improved reference documentation for attributes on many elements. 
    |section[s.50b2]
      |title Changes in DocBook V5.0b2
      |para This release addresses several bugs identified in V5.0b1.
      |orderedlist
        |listitem[svg.mathml]
          |para When SVG or MathML are used, allow more than one element from the respective namespace to be used in the appropriate location. 
        |listitem[rfe.1356238]
          |para
            Fixed |{link :href http://sourceforce.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&group_id=21935&atid=384107&aid=1356238 RFE 1356238}: the |{tag.attribute xrefstyle} attribute on |{tag olink} is now “|{literal text}” rather than “|{literal xsd:IDREF}”. 
        |listitem[rfe.1380477]
          |para
            Fixed |{link :href http://sourceforce.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&group_id=21935&atid=384107&aid=1380477 RFE 1380477}: Make |{tag.attribute xml:id} optional on |{tag area}s within |{tag areaset}; allow linking attributes on |{tag areaset}; establish the semantics that an |{tag area}|{tag areaset} inherits its linking attributes from the |{tag areaset} if it doesn't have linking attributes of its own.
        |listitem
          |para
            Allow |{tag alt} inside |{tag equation}, |{tag informalequation}, and |{tag inlineequation}. 
        |listitem[rfe.1356254]
          |para
            Fixed |{link :href http://sourceforce.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&group_id=21935&atid=384107&aid=1356254 RFE 1356254}: |{uri dbforms.rnc} schema now supports the HTML form elements.
